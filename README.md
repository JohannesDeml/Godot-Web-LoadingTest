## Notes

* This is very much work in progress. I'm mostly developing with Unity and the comparison to my [unity webgl project](https://github.com/JohannesDeml/UnityWebGL-LoadingTest) might not be fair, since I have a lot more experience there and also fine-tuned it over the last years.
* I haven't come around to use brotli or gzip compression (I would like to have it baked in the file similar to Unity's solution), therefore download sizes are a lot bigger than they need to be - With a test to compress an optimized build with brotli I would get to 4MB, I just need to find out how to load it now.
* Starting the engine takes a long time - with a custom export template that does not include all engine features this should be faster - You can find one [here](https://deml.io/experiments/godot-webgl/4.1.2-custom-template)
* Exporting the project is a bliss compared to Unity, it is finished in a second while for Unity it takes 10+ minutes on my laptop.
* In Godot 4.1 shadows are not yet supported on WebGL (Shadows do work for Godot 3.5)
